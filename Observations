OBSERVATIONS
> Given below are several situations occuring in different  
environments. Each situation consists of what happened, what 
assumption failed, and what can be noted down. The aim of 
this note is to derive information on relations, problems, 
and other concepts that can help solve the issue of "Where do systems
break?".

Situation:
During studying time, the parents (system) expected their son 
(person A) to study.

What happened:
Their son watched movies instead.

Assumption that failed: 
The system assumed sustained attention for a period of time from 
person A.

Notes:
This will be observed repeatedly in different contexts.
The system has no feedback loop, no contingency, and no ownership
of attention.
